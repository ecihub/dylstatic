            degree of care as Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like kind, but in no event
            less than reasonable care. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that its Representatives
            observe these obligations as if they were parties to the Agreement and Customer's Subscription related

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">12.1. Compliance with Laws</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In addition to the terms included in Addendum B attached hereto, Customer agrees to
            comply with all applicable United States and any and all other applicable international, national, state,
            provincial and/or local laws, regulations, codes, ordinances, treaties, conventions, and/or court and/or
            administrative orders and/or rulings ("Laws") in relation to Customer's access to and/or use of the
            Services, Customer's related Services Subscription thereto, and the DYL Platform, generally. You shall be
            solely responsible for familiarizing yourself with such Laws and shall not treat or rely on any statements,
            communications and/or materials provided by DYL or any of its Affiliates as legal advice.
            Without limiting the foregoing: </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(a) Import and Export. If and as applicable, Customer shall comply with all export
            and import laws of the United States and other jurisdictions applicable to its access to and/or use of the
            Subscription Services, including the DYL Platform, and/or to its related use and/or transport of Equipment.
            Customer shall not access or use any of the Services in a United States embargoed country. Customer
            represents and warrants that neither Customer nor any Customer Agent nor any Representatives are named on
            any United States government denied-party list. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(b) Solicitations/Telemarketing. Many jurisdictions have Laws that significantly
            restrict telephone solicitations (i.e., telemarketing) and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems
            ("ATDS"), artificial or pre-recorded voice messages, SMS text messages and facsimile communications. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer hereby acknowledges that DYL is a service provider which provides Services
            as described herein and therefore agrees that DYL cannot regulate, control and/or govern the actions and/or
            decisions of third-parties over whom and/or to which DYL otherwise has no authority or control, nor can DYL
            regulate, control and/or govern Customer's behavior to include Customer's actual use of Customer's otherwise
            lawful Subscription Services, beyond requiring Customer's consent to the express, relative Agreement terms
            provided for herein. By way of example and, hereby now made a part of this Agreement, Customer acknowledges
            and agrees that DYL shall not be responsible if Customer is 'blocked' consequent to Customer violating any
            Laws, including, without limitation, those related to 'spamming' during any or all respective Term of
            Customer's Services Subscription.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer hereby agrees that Customer is solely responsible for (i) ensuring
            Customer's use of any and all of Customer's Subscription Services comply with any and all such Laws,
            including, without limitation, Customer adding "opt out" options to text messages, if and where applicable,
            (ii) obtaining any required consent(s) from the parties to be contacted by Customer and, (iii) maintaining
            an internal "do not call" list to prevent contacting parties that do not wish to receive further
            communications from Customer. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER IS URGED TO SEEK THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL PRIOR TO PURCHASING, SUBSCRIBING TO
            AND/OR USING ANY OF THE SERVICES AND/OR EQUIPMENT FOR MARKETING OR SOLICITATION PURPOSES. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(c) Voice Recording and Call Monitoring. Many jurisdictions also require advance
            notice or consent to permit electronic voice recording and/or third-party call monitoring. While
            Subscription Services are intended to comply with the requirements of applicable United States state laws,
            Customer remains solely responsible for also ensuring compliance with any and all other applicable Laws.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">12.2. Other Compliance &amp; Use Restrictions</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer agrees to comply with and to cause its Agents, Representatives and any and
            all other third-parties having access to and/or whom or which use Customer's Services Subscription, to
            comply with the provisions of Addendum B (Use Restrictions) attached hereto.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(a) Without DYL's prior written consent (where applicable), you may not access or
            use any of the Services in violation of any Laws, including those for any unfair business purposes and/or
            practices pursuant to the California Business &amp; Professions Code §§17200 et seq., same of which is
            intended to include, without limitation, if you are a competitor of DYL, for purposes of monitoring the
            availability of any Services, performance and/or functionality, nor for any other benchmarking, bad faith,
            malicious, fraudulent, infringing, and/or illegally competitive or unfair purpose(s).</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(b) In addition to the aforementioned and the terms of Addendum B attached hereto,
            you may only access and/or use the Services associated to your Subscription for your internal business
            purposes and shall not: (i) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of
            applicable Laws; (ii) send and/or store infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or
            tortious material(s), including material(s) reasonably understood as harmful to children or in violation of

            contained therein or related thereto; or (v) attempt to gain unauthorized access to any of the Services
            and/or its related systems or networks including, without limitation, the DYL Platform.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">(c) You hereby agree that you shall not, (i) license, sell, resell, transfer,
            assign, distribute or otherwise commercially exploit or jeopardize, in any way whatsoever, any of the
            Services, the DYL Platform, any other DYL Confidential Information, your Subscription, and/or any
            impermissible Content and/or data related thereto; (ii) modify, amend and/or make any derivative work(s)
            wholly or partially based upon any or all of the Services, including those of your Subscription, any DYL
            Confidential Information, and/or the DYL Platform; (iii) create Internet "links" to the Services, including
            to your Subscription Services, or "frame" or "mirror" any Content or DYL Confidential Information on any
            other server, wireless, and/or Internet‐based device; or (iv) reverse engineer and/or access and/or use any
            or all of the Services, the DYL Platform, any Content which would otherwise reveal any DYL Confidential
            Information, and/or any other DYL Confidential Information, to directly or indirectly (a) build one or more
            competitive products and/or services; (b) to build one or more products and/or services which use similar
            features, functionalities, graphics, or any other DYL Confidential Information related to any or all of the
            Services, the DYL Platform, and/or your Subscription, inclusive of the Content, or; (c) to replicate,
            duplicate and/or copy any of the features, functions, graphics and/or other DYL Confidential Information
            related to any or all of the Services, DYL Platform, your Subscription and/or its Content, by any method
            and/or through any medium, whether now known or hereinafter devised.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">12.3. Unlimited Plans</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL reserves the right to review the usage of any unlimited minute usage plan(s)
            associated to your Subscription Services to ensure that you are not abusing same. You agree to use any and
            all unlimited minute plans associated to your Subscription Services for a reasonable amount of voice or fax
            calls, as further described in this Section 12.3 below, and will not employ methods and/or devices to take
            advantage of unlimited plans associated to your Subscription Services by excessively using the voice or fax
            Subscription Services and/or for means reasonably understood as not intended for your Subscription Services,
            including, without limitation, use that is in violation of the terms of Addendum B. Amongst any and all
            other recourse, right and/or remedy available to DYL and hereby expressly reserved, DYL may terminate your
            Services Subscription immediately if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you are abusing any such
            unlimited minute plan associated to your Subscription and/or the Services. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">For purposes of this Agreement, "unlimited usage" relates to the combined number of
            inbound and outbound voice minutes and fax pages, but otherwise excludes advertising and informational
            messages sent to you by DYL, as determined by DYL in its sole discretion. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">12.3(a). Statistically Abusive Use. You agree that your level/amount of usage of
            the unlimited service plan(s) associated to your Services Subscription shall not be Statistically Abusive in
            comparison to that of the average, similar DYL customer utilizing similar plans in relation to their or its
            use of similar Services. DYL deems usage that exceeds the average volume of its other total combined
            unlimited usage plan customers by more than FIFTEEN-PERCENT (15%) as statistically abusive ("Statistically
            Abusive"). You agree that DYL has the right to terminate your Services Subscription or charge you additional
            Subscription Fees if your usage is Statistically Abusive, as solely but reasonably determined by DYL.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer agrees to use unlimited voice plans for normal voice and/or text message
            related communications with aggregate usage that is not Statistically Abusive. Use of unlimited "paperless
            facsimile" service must also fall within the average range of similarly situated DYL customers and shall be
            considered Statistically Abusive if usage exceeds 500 transmitted pages sent or received per month.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In addition, Customer agrees that Customer will not employ methods or use devices
            to take advantage of unlimited plans by using Subscription Services excessively or for means not intended by
            DYL. DYL may terminate your Subscription Services immediately if it determines, in its sole discretion,
            Customer is Statistically Abusing an unlimited minute plan. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer agrees that DYL has the right to terminate this Agreement and thereby
            consequently cancel Customer's Services Subscription and/or charge Customer additional fees as outlined
            below if Customer's usage is determined to be Statistically Abusive in the sole discretion of DYL. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">12.3(b). Excessive Usage. If it is determined that Customer's usage is
            Statistically Abusive, Customer hereby agrees to pay a per minute, per text message, and/or per page fee, as
            respectively applicable, for use in excess of typical levels at the then current rate established by DYL, of
            at least $.05 per minute for voice calls, $.05 per text message, and/or $.05 per facsimile page. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">THIS OVERAGE FEE APPLIES TO ALL PLANS INCLUDING THE UNLIMITED PLANS. A Customer's
            aggregate usage may be considered Statistically Abusive if involves excessive:</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">15.2. Multiple-line Subscription</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">If Customer has a multiple-line Subscription by which two (2) or more telephone
            numbers are associated to Customer's Subscription Services and Customer elects to engage the services of a
            third-party service provider to port one or more numbers from your DYL Services Subscription, you hereby
            agree to provide us at least three (3) business days' advanced notice of your intent to eliminate the
            specifically affected Services and/or Equipment. You may provide said notice to, service@dyl.com, and/or by
            calling DYL Customer Care at, (888) 310-4474. Your failure to follow these terms may consequently result in
            DYL continuing to bill you for such affected Subscription Services and/or Equipment, as a part of your then
            Subscription Fee. If and after such affected Subscription Services and/or related Equipment has been
            properly and formally eliminated from your DYL Subscription Services, as determined in DYL's sole and
            absolute discretion, you shall thereafter remain responsible for your Subscription Fee, if and as adjusted,

        <p class="primary-content-p">If and when Customer requests that DYL ports one or more telephone numbers from a
            preexisting Customer service provider to DYL, DYL will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the
            porting of the subject number(s). Customer acknowledges that it is industry standard for service providers
            which provide services similar to DYL's Services to require identification verification along with
            authorization and other reasonable information when porting phone numbers to DYL. As such, Customer must (1)
            properly complete a letter of authorization; (2) provide us with a copy of your most recent bill from the
            service provider from which we are to port one or more numbers from, and; (3) provide us with any other
            information required by such service provider to port your number(s). Customer's failure to provide any
            information requested by DYL and/or the third-party service provider will likely delay the porting of the
            subject number(s) to DYL. DYL shall not be responsible nor held liable for any and all delays related to the
            porting of your number(s) nor will we provide any whole or partial Subscription Fee credit(s) for any and
            all such delays.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">15.4. Porting Information via the Internet</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In DYL's sole and absolute discretion, DYL may offer Customer the option to submit
            the requisite information described in Section 15.3 above, to port one or more of Customer's numbers via a
            web-enabled interface. Should DYL make this option available to Customer and should Customer accept same,
            Customer may obtain a gratuitous copy of all relative porting information from the aforementioned interface
            or, by contacting DYL Customer Care via email or by phone at, service@dyl.com, or, (888) 310-4474. DYL shall
            provide Customer's Lead Administrator with a copy of the subject information by facsimile or email. No
            additional software or hardware will be required. Customer may also withdraw Customer's consent to
            submitting web-enabled/electronic porting requests by contacting DYL Customer Care as provided above;
            HOWEVER, to do so, Customer MUST rescind Customer's consent PRIOR to DYL submitting and/or transmitting the
            porting request to its respective Affiliate or other relative Representative. Your consent to any and all
            such electronic porting submissions shall only apply to each respective porting request you submit via the
            aforementioned web-enabled/electronic interface.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Contingent upon the following along with any and all other relative terms in this
            Agreement, you may select one or more new phone numbers to use with your Subscription. You acknowledge that
            certain numbers may not be available for various reasons including, without limitation, a delay in one or
            more pertinent database update(s). Therefore, when you seek to reserve one or more numbers from DYL's
            inventory, you must test each number by calling it from a line outside the DYL network (e.g., landline,
            cellphone, or from a non-DYL number) within 48 hours of your relative reservation to confirm each number has

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">ADDENDUM A - 911 | E911 |EMERGENCY SERVICES</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">This addendum ("Addendum A") is an attachment to, and part of, the Agreement. The
            provisions in Addendum A apply to Subscription Services provided to Customer locations in the United States
            of America.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">1. E911 SERVICE</h2>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.1 General</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") maintains varying carrier
            requirements in the United States with relation to VoIP 911 service, E911 service, Basic or Enhanced 9-1-1
            service, or, where available, NG9-1-1 service (collectively, "E911 Capability" or, "E911 Capable").
            Generally speaking, E911 Capability is a mandatory component of all inbound/outbound traditional fax and
            voice service plans (each, an "E911 Capable Line"). E911 Capability is not however offered on virtual
            numbers, toll-free numbers nor, IMPORTANTLY, on the Services offered via the DYL Platform, same of which
            include Customer's Subscription Services, Equipment related thereto, and/or any and all similar Services
            accessories or add-on Services plans.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The DYL Platform strictly uses VoIP technology to provide its communication
            Services. VoIP is a communications technology that uses "Internet protocol" instead of traditional analog
            systems. </p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.2 How VoIP Works</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">VoIP converts the voice signal from your telephone or Equipment into a digital
            signal that can travel over the Internet. Depending on the VoIP Services and Equipment you purchase, you may
            need a computer, a special VoIP telephone, or a regular telephone with an adapter. </p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.3 Special Acknowledgements for Customer's Services Subscription</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees to the following:</p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL'S SERVICES DO NOT SUPPORT 911 EMERGENCY DIALING NOR OTHER EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS
            IN THE SAME MANNER THAT TRADITIONAL WIRELINE 911 SERVICES WORK.</p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">ANY AND ALL EQUIPMENT WHICH OTHERWISE OPERATES SUBSEQUENT TO SERVICES, INCLUDING
            CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, ALSO DOES NOT AND WILL NOT SUPPORT 911 EMERGENCY DIALING OR OTHER
            EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS IN THE SAME MANNER THAT TRADITIONAL WIRELINE 911 SERVICES WORK.</p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND DIFFERENCES DETAILED IN THE
            AGREEMENT AND IN THIS ADDENDUM WITH RELATION TO E911 CAPABLE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS A PROFESSIONAL
            COURTESY BUT ARE OTHERWISE NON-EXHAUSTIVE. </p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER AGREES TO NOTIFY ITS ADMINISTRATOR(S), AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, AND
            EMPLOYEES, ALONG WITH ANY AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO MAY PLACE CALLS USING CUSTOMER'S SERVICES SUBSCRIPTION
            AND/OR RELATIVE EQUIPMENT, OF THE E911 CAPABLE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND HEREUNDER. </p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CUSTOMER WAS ADVISED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING AN
            ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING TRADITIONAL EMERGENCY 911 SERVICES.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.4 Services Location</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Services Subscriptions which include one or more E911 Capable Lines are only
            available in select areas. If Customer subscribes to an E911 Capable Line, Customer will be required and
            hereby agrees to register the physical location of Customer's Services Subscription Equipment with DYL by
            contacting DYL at service@dyl.com, or by calling, (888) 310-4474. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO
            REVIEW AND CONFIRM THE ACCURACY OF SUCH INFORMATION AND TO URGENTLY MODIFY IT IF AND AS NECESSARY. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Moreover, Customer agrees to contact DYL to update the relevant location
            information whenever the physical location of Customer's Services Subscription and/or Equipment changes. If
            Customer subscribes to DYL mobile applications as a part of Customer's Services Subscription, the physical
            location registered for Customer's Services Subscription Equipment shall be the physical location registered
            for the mobile application associated with said Equipment. Customer acknowledges and understands that any
            enhanced location information forwarded to any emergency operator by DYL will be based upon the physical
            location provided to DYL by Customer. In the event that the physical location has not been updated or is
            incomplete, DYL may attempt to route an ermergency 911 call based upon the bill-to or ship-to addresses
            associated with Customer's Subscription. </p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.5 E911 Characteristics &amp; Limitations</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT E911 CAPABLE SERVICES AND SERVICES ASSOCIATED TO AN E911
            CAPABLE LINE HAVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT DISTINGUISH THEM FROM TRADITIONAL, LEGACY, CIRCUIT-SWITCHED 911
            SERVICE LINES. THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY MAKE THE DYL SERVICES ASSOCIATED TO ANY AND ALL E911 CAPABLE LINES
            UNSUITABLE FOR CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE
            TECHNOLOGY OR COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES BEST SUITED TO MEET CUSTOMER'S EMERGENCY CALLING NEEDS, AND TO
            MAKE THE NECESSARY PROVISIONS FOR ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CALLING SERVICES (SUCH AS MAINTAINING A CONVENTIONAL
            LANDLINE PHONE OR WIRELESS PHONE AS A BACKUP MEANS OF COMPLETING EMERGENCY CALLS). </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">IN ADDITION TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE
            PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS AND FURTHER CONFINES THAT DISTINGUISH E911 CAPABLE SERVICES AND E911 CAPABLE LINES
            FROM TRADITIONAL, LEGACY, CIRCUIT-SWITCHED 911 SERVICE:
            ELECTRICAL POWER. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND THOSE ASSOCIATED TO E911 CAPABLE LINES,
            WILL NOT FUNCTION IN THE ABSENCE OF ELECTRICAL POWER. IF THERE IS A POWER OUTAGE, CUSTOMER MAY BE REQUIRED
            TO RESET AND/OR RECONFIGURE EQUIPMENT BEFORE BEING ABLE TO USE SOME OR ALL OF CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION
            SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY SERVICES ASSOCIATED TO E911 CAPABLE LINE(S).</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">INTERNET ACCESS. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND THOSE
            ASSOCIATED TO E911 CAPABLE LINES, WILL NOT FUNCTION IF THERE IS AN INTERRUPTION OR SIGNIFICANT DEGRADATION
            OF CUSTOMER'S BROADBAND OR HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE.
            NON-VOICE SYSTEMS. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND THOSE ASSOCIATED TO E911
            CAPABLE LINES, ARE NOT SETUP TO FUNCTION WITH TEXT MESSAGES OR OUT-DIALING SYSTEMS INCLUDING HOME SECURITY
            SYSTEMS, MEDICAL MONITORING EQUIPMENT, TTY EQUIPMENT, AND/OR ENTERTAINMENT OR SATELLITE TELEVISION SYSTEMS.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">EQUIPMENT FAILURE. THE SERVICES, INCLUDING CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND
            THOSE ASSOCIATED TO E911 CAPABLE LINES WILL NOT FUNCTION IF CUSTOMER'S EQUIPMENT FAILS OR IS NOT CONFIGURED
            CORRECTLY. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">SERVICE FAILURE OR SHUT-OFF. IF CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE
            ASSOCIATED TO ONE OR MORE E911 CAPABLE LINES, IF ANY, ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO, SUSPENSION OR CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND/OR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, BE IT
            FOR NON-PAYMENT OR ANY OTHER REASON(S) SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">INCORRECT LOCATION DATA. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE ACTUAL
            LOCATION OF THE RESPECTIVE EQUIPMENT AT THE TIME OF ACTIVATION OF CUSTOMER'S SERVICES SUBSCRIPTION AND
            WHENEVER UPDATING SAME WITH DYL, E911 COMMUNICATIONS MAY NOT BE DIRECTED TO THE CORRECT LOCAL EMERGENCY
            OPERATOR.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">LOCATION UPDATING DELAY. FOLLOWING ANY CHANGE(S) INTENDED TO UPDATE THE PHYSICAL
            LOCATION OF CUSTOMER AND/OR EQUIPMENT, THERE MAY BE SOME AMOUNT OF DELAY BEFORE THE AUTOMATIC NUMBER AND
            LOCATION INFORMATION IS FORWARDED TO THE LOCAL EMERGENCY CAPABLE LINE OR SERVICE OPERATOR. SUCH INFORMATION
            IS TYPICALLY FIRST POPULATED INTO DYL's E911 DATABASES PRIOR TO CUSTOMER'S SERVICES SUBSCRIPTION ACTIVATION,
            BUT DYL CANNOT GUARANTEE THIS OR ANY OTHER TIMING.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">INCOMPATIBILITY WITH SYSTEMS OF OPERATOR. THE LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICE OPERATOR
            RECEIVING DYL E911 EMERGENCY CAPABLE LINE SERVICE CALLS MAY NOT HAVE A SYSTEM CONFIGURED FOR E911 CAPABLE
            LINE SERVICES OR BE ABLE TO CAPTURE AND/OR RETAIN AUTOMATIC NUMBERS OR LOCATION INFORMATION. THIS MEANS THAT
            THE OPERATOR MAY NOT KNOW THE PHONE NUMBER OR PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMER, ADMINISTRATOR, AGENT OR ANY
            OTHER INDIVIDUAL ACTING ON THE CUSTOMER'S BEHALF WHO IS MAKING THE DYL E911 CAPABLE LINE CALL. DUE IN
            SIGNIFICANT PART TO TECHNICAL FACTORS IN NETWORK CONFIGURATION AND/OR DESIGN AND, IN THE EVENT OF NETWORK
            CONGESTION ON THE DYL NETWORK USED FOR E911 CAPABLE LINES, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A DYL E911 CALL WILL
            PRODUCE A BUSY SIGNAL OR WILL EXPERIENCE UNEXPECTED ANSWERING WAIT TIMES AND/OR MAY TAKE LONGER TO ANSWER
            THAN E911 CALLS PLACED VIA TRADITIONAL, LEGACY, CIRCUIT-SWITCHED TELEPHONE NETWORKS. </p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">1.6 E911 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">WITHOUT LIMITING SECTION 16 OF THE AGREEMENT INASMUCH AS IT RELATES TO THE GLOBAL

            EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT DYL SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER TO ANY AND ALL OF THE
            AFOREMENTIONED POSSIBILITIES, NOR TO ANY AND ALL CONSEQUENT RESULTS. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In addition to the indemnification terms provided in the Agreement, Customer
            further expressly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless DYL from any and all third-party claims, losses,

            information concerning Customer's Services Subscription address(es), or to update Customer's registered
            address(es) for any Services E911 Capable, or (b) Customer's failure to properly notify any person who may

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">IV. Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL may have already begun collecting information from you (described more fully
            below), including Personally Identifiable Information, when you were a prospective customer. All such
            customer/Customer acquisition information collected by DYL shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as,
            "Information".</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Subject to applicable Laws, we gather Information from prospective customers
            through one or more online and/or offline communications including, without limitation, in-person meetings,
            web forms, emails, text messages and phone calls. We often collect contact Information from Representatives
            and/or Agents of our prospective customers, which may therefore include Customer, such as name, company
            name, address, email address, and telephone number. As we communicate with the prospective customer, which
            may therefore include Customer, and/or their respective Representatives and/or Agents, we may gather
            additional Information, such as the prospective customer's (which may therefore include Customer's) industry
            and/or revenues. We may also use data-appending methods to gather additional Information, such as by
            reviewing biographical information posted by the prospective customer, you, Representatives and/or Agents,
            via the Internet. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">We sometimes additionally gather Information about Representatives' and/or Agents'
            communications preferences. In addition, we gather Information based on prospective customers' systems and
            behavior in viewing our website pages and files, including what pages and/or files are viewed, when viewed,
            the time spent on each page, browser and operating system Information, Internet Protocol address, the domain
            associated with that address, and location Information, and may have and/or may continue to subsequently
            gather all or some of same from you. We may also collect Information based on prospective customers'
            behavior in opening and viewing emails, such as whether an email is opened and how long it is viewed, and
            may therefore have performed and/or will perform similar with regard to Customer. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Finally, DYL gathers information from users of its website, which may therefore
            include Customer. DYL uses cookies to gather information from site visitors, including Customer. We use this
            information to analyze how visitors, including Customer, use our website and to better match their
            experience on our website with their interests. DYL also gathers information concerning the search terms
            that website visitors, including Customer, have used to reach our website.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Once prospective customers enter into this Services Agreement with DYL and,
            pursuant to its terms, we collect and maintain further information, in addition to the aforesaid
            Information, about Customer's Agreement including, without limitation, payment information, information
            about each Customer transaction, Subscription Services configurations and settings, recorded calls,
            messages, meetings, voicemails, incoming and outgoing faxes, Customer-saved or stored Content (as
            permissible), email and text message communications, and call center Customer information you provide to us.
            Our systems, inclusive of the DYL Platform, also generate reports and information which are stored in
            Customer's Subscription. We may further collect information needed to deliver online Services, support,
            and/or training to customers, including Customer. For example, we gather information to register Customer's
            Subscription Services, such as a user name and password.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Subject to applicable Laws, Calls with DYL Sales, Customer Care and/or other DYL
            Representative and/or Affiliate group(s) may be recorded to gather information to improve Services. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Children are not eligible to use DYL's website or its associated Services.
            We ask that minors (under age 18) not submit Personally Identifiable Information to DYL.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">VI. Customer Choice</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Once a Customer, you have the option of setting certain communications preferences.
            For example, you have the option of telling us that you do not want us to use Information previously
            provided and/or information you subsequently provide as a Customer, for further marketing purposes and/or
            contact. Moreover, all electronic communications shall offer an opt-out option.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">VII. Sharing and Transfer of Information (Onward Transfer)</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Some information/Information we collect and store under this Privacy Policy may be
            in the possession of third-parties such as Affiliates and/or Representatives for the delivery of DYL's
            Services, including the DYL Platform. We require these third-party Affiliates and Representatives to protect
            that information/Information with the same privacy and security controls required of us pursuant to the
            Agreement.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Without limiting relative Agreement terms, DYL reserves the right to share or
            transfer your information and/or Information, which may subsequently include, without limitation, Customer
            Data and/or Content and/or permissible Confidential Information, in connection with a potential or actual
            sale, merger, reorganization, or other transfer of all or substantially all of DYL's assets (including under
            bankruptcy proceedings). Moreover, and in further alignment with Agreement terms, we may also share or
            disclose any or all of same (hereinafter collectively, "Agreement Material") if we receive a request or
            demand for such in the form of:</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">A court order to disclose such Agreement Material;</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">What we reasonably believe and understand to be part of the lawful process of a
            criminal investigation or proceeding, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order;</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Judicial or administrative service of process in civil proceedings, such as
            subpoenas or discovery requests; or</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">A national security letter or similar request from any state or federal law
            enforcement agency.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">We have no obligation to notify you of the receipt of any such request or demand.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">We also reserve the right to share or transfer Agreement Material if and when same
            is required under any applicable Laws.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Finally, we reserve the right to share anything not considered Personally
            Identifiable Information, such as aggregated information without personally identifiable elements and any
            de-identified or anonymized information. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Except as otherwise provided for in the terms of Agreement, inclusive of this
            Privacy Policy, it is DYL's policy not to share information that we collect with third-parties, without your
            consent. DYL does not sell or rent any lists of prospective customers or customers, including Customer.</p>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">VIII. Legal Terms</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Your Subscription is subject to the terms of Agreement between you and DYL. This
            Privacy Policy is an integral part of that Agreement.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.
            Among the other acceptance methods previously provided in the Agreement and Privacy Policy and, in alignment
            with same, your continued use of DYL Services and/or of its website and/or continued communications with DYL
            shall indicate and further demonstrate that you continue to agree to the Agreement, inclusive of this
            Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time, respectively.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">SUPPLEMENT 1</h2>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">Telephone Consumer Protection Action Compliance</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">("TCPA Compliant-Capable" or "Supplement 1")</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL cares about its Customers and upholding its principled and respected business
            reputation. As a result, DYL implements significant and ongoing efforts to ensure DYL Services are compliant
            with applicable United States laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA")</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Upon seeking routine advice from DYL's national telemarketing law and compliance
            expert April 2017, it was determined once again that DYL Services remain TCPA Compliant-Capable. Without
            limiting the foregoing, same includes DYL Services such as, CampaignConnect™, and, LeadConnect™.
        </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Federal law generally makes it illegal to call any wireless phone (business or
            consumer) using an automatic telephone dialing system ("ATDS") for telemarketing purposes without prior
            express, written consent. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") defines an ATDS as, "equipment that
            has the capacity to (a) store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number
            generator and; (b) to dial such numbers."1 The key term in this definition is "capacity." The FCC has held
            that this definition covers any equipment or software which has the capacity to generate numbers and dial
            them without human intervention, regardless of whether the numbers called are randomly or sequentially
            generated or come from calling lists." </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In a recent Declaratory Ruling, the FCC expanded upon their prior interpretation of
            the term "capacity" to include future/potential capacity.3 As such, the FCC sought to include systems that
            can (or could be quickly and inexpensively altered to) "dial numbers without human intervention" and "dial
            thousands of numbers in a short period of time."4 DYL's Services do not fall within these parameters. DYL's
            Services can neither be quickly nor inexpensively altered to incorporate the requisite "capacity" feature
            and; while other third-parties which provide services similar to DYL may characteristically include said
            "capacity" capability, DYL's subject Services require human intervention to operate and subsequently further
            lack the "capacity" to function as an ATDS. Moreover, as of the Effective Date, DYL has no plans to modify
            any of its Services in a manner that would result in same having the "capacity" to function as an ATDS. DYL
            simply remains committed to complying with applicable U.S. laws, including the TCPA, and passing those
            benefits down to the Customer. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The FCC further construed the definition of an ATDS to capture all systems that
            "retain the capacity to dial thousands of numbers in a short period of time."5 Predictive dialers, for
            example, have the requisite capacity. DYL's Services have no such predictive dialing capacity.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Citing, Ung v. Universal Acceptance Corporation6, which serves as but one good
            example case amongst others, it was concluded that, "[w]ithout the capacity to dial on its own, telephone
            [E]quipment simply cannot be an ATDS." </p>
        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL Services lack the aforementioned capacity. It was subsequently determined and
            opinioned via DYL's telemarketing law and compliance expert that, DYL Services are not considered an ATDS
            and are subsequently TCPA Compliant-Capable.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">SUPPLEMENT 2</h2>

        <h3 class="primary-content-h3">Privacy Laws &amp; Notice Requirements for Electronic Recording of Telephone
            Conversations</h3>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The information herein provided is primarily public domain general information
            concerning electronic recording of telephone conversations. Nevertheless, and for purposes of the Agreement,
            the following information relative to applicable Laws shall be referred to and incorporated into the
            Agreement as, "Supplement 2".</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">DYL is not dispensing any legal advice nor does it profess the accuracy of the
            information provided in Supplement 2. If you have questions concerning legal implications of the following
            information, you should contact a qualified attorney for advice.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">In addition to Agreement terms incorporating DYL's limited liability relative to
            Customer's use of Subscription Services, DYL is not legally responsible for any misinterpretation, lack of
            understanding or lack of knowledge regarding the use of electronic recordings, including your proper or
            improper use of Subscription Services. It is your responsibility to acquaint yourself with the proper
            knowledge for legal use of any and all relative Subscription Services. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">There are both federal and state laws governing the use of electronic, mechanical
            or other device recordings. The unlawful use of such equipment, including any Equipment, can give rise not
            only to a civil suit by the "injured" party, but also criminal prosecution. Accordingly, it is critical that
            you know the applicable Laws that apply and what the rights and responsibilities are when recording and
            disclosing communications.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Call recording laws vary from state to state. These state laws pertain to obtaining
            either single-party (only you, the caller need to provide consent) or multi-party consent (all parties on
            the call need to provide consent) before a call can be recorded. If you are calling from or to a multi-party
            consent state, then the consent of all parties on the phone is required to record the call. If you are
            calling from and to a single-party consent state, then additional consent is not required.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">1. Consent</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">US Federal laws only require a single-party to consent to recording a telephone
            conversation. However, individual states have laws that require multiple-parties to a call to provide
            consent. Federal and many state laws do not protect recording of calls for criminal or tortuous purposes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">2. Federal and State Laws</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Federal Statute: Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 ("ECPA"), 18
            U.S.C.§§ 2510-2522.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">There are two exceptions to the prohibition against call monitoring:</p>

        <ul class="prod-feature-ul fa-ul">
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-circle-right voice"></i>Consent of at least one party to the call</li>
            <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-chevron-circle-right voice"></i>Ordinary course of business exception</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The ordinary course of business exception applies where the call recording concerns
            the legitimate operation of and is during the "ordinary course of business".</p>
        <p class="primary-content-p"><a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C119.txt" target="_blank">US House Download</a></p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">3. State Statutes</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">While the U.S. federal law only requires one-party consent, many states have
            drafted different statutes. In some states, all parties must give their consent or at least be notified that
            the call is about to be recorded (with necessary opt-out option).
            You understand that many states have call-recording/monitoring restrictions. You will ensure that you and
            your Agents and/or Representatives promptly inform all call recipients at the outset of any call, that the
            call may be monitored or recorded, if you choose to monitor or record any calls whatsoever. You and your
            Agents and/or Representatives, respectively, will politely end the call if the recipient objects to the
            recording/monitoring. DYL assumes no liability if you, or any of your Agents and/or Representatives fail to
            make such disclosures and you will indemnify DYL for any such errors. </p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Even when call-recording is disabled: If you and/or any of your Agents and/or
            Representatives elect to enable call-monitoring even when calling to or from states that have local call
            recording restrictions ("two party" or "all party" monitoring states), or fielding calls from such states,
            you agree that you will always disclose at the outset that the call may be monitored.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The 5 states that have more restrictive local cell-phone telemarketing rules are
            below. These are states where, even when calling manually, you need consent to make a marketing call to a
            cell phone. Note that EBR's are exempt in Wyoming (need EBR instead of consent):</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Arizona: Arizona Revised Stat. § 44-1278(B)(3) - "It is an unlawful practice
            pursuant to section 44-1522 for any seller or solicitor or anyone acting on their behalf who conducts a
            telephone solicitation in this state to do any of the following: (3) Intentionally make or cause to be made
            any unsolicited telephone sales call to any mobile or telephone paging device."</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Louisiana: Louisiana Public Service Commission's Do Not Call Program General Order
            (V)(A)(12)(b) - "No call will be placed to: (b) To any telephone number assigned to a paging service,
            cellular or mobile telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other radio common carrier
            service, or any service for which the called party is charged for the call, unless the call is made pursuant
            to the recipient's prior express consent."</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">New Jersey: NJ Rev Stat § 56:8-130(a) - "A telemarketer shall not make or
            cause to be made any unsolicited telemarketing sales call to a commercial mobile service device of any
            customer…"</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Texas: Texas Stat. Title 10 § 305.001 - "A person may not make a telephone
            call or use an automatic dial announcing device to make a telephone call for the purpose of making a sale
            if: (1) the person making the call or using the device knows or should have known that the called number is
            a mobile telephone for which the called person will be charged for that specific call; and (2) the called
            person has not consented to the making of such a call to the person calling or using the device or to the
            business enterprise for which the person is calling or using the device."</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Wyoming: WY Stat § 40-12-302(e) - "No telephone solicitor or merchant shall
            willfully make or cause to be made any unsolicited telephonic sales call to any unpublished cellular
            telephone number."</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">4. "Business telephone" exception</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The "business telephone" exception, which generally allows monitoring of calls and
            taping over an extension phone which is both provided to a subscriber in the ordinary course of a telephone
            company's business and is being used by that subscriber in the ordinary course of its business. This
            provision generally permits businesses to monitor the conversations of their employees, including personal
            conversations.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Penalties: The federal statutes provide criminal penalties for unlawful
            interception of telephone conversations, including up to five (5) years' imprisonment or a maximum of
            $10,000 in fines. They also allow for civil remedies by which private parties are entitled to recover actual
            and punitive damages, together with fees and costs.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">5. Evidentiary Issues</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Individuals and businesses that make surreptitious recordings often do so with the
            expectation that the recordings will be useful as evidence. Such recordings are subject to significant
            barriers to use as evidence including, without limitation, if recordings are made in violation of either
            federal or state law, the recording(s) will almost certainly be inadmissible and, even if lawfully recorded,
            the tapes will be exempt from the hearsay rule and will not be usable for impeachment, in most
            jurisdictions. Anyone contemplating an evidentiary use of surreptitious recordings should consult with a
            qualified attorney prior to making the recording(s).</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">6. Recording Telephone Calls with Parties in Different Jurisdictions</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Federal law may apply when the conversation is between parties who are in different
            states, although it is unsettled whether a court will hold in a given case that federal law "pre-empts"
            state law, but either state may choose to enforce its own laws. Therefore it is better to err on the side of
            caution when recording an interstate telephone call.</p>

        <h2 class="primary-content-h1">7. The Role of FCC</h2>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The FCC's role in assisting consumers who believe their telephone conversations
            were unlawfully recorded is generally limited to ensuring that telephone companies enforce their tariff
            provisions regarding recording of telephone conversations. The only penalty that can be enforced by the
            local carrier is revocation of telephone service which may then include relative Subscription Services (in
            the matter of use of electronic recordings in connection with telephone service/relative Subscription
            Services.)</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The FCC protects the privacy of telephone conversations by requiring notification
            before a electronic recording is used to record interstate or foreign telephone conversations. These types
            of conversations may not be recorded unless the use of a electronic recording is:</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Preceded by verbal or written consent of all parties to the telephone conversation;
            or</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Preceded by verbal notification which is recorded at the beginning, and as part of
            the call, by the recording party; or</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Accompanied by an automatic tone warning device, sometimes called a beep tone,
            which automatically produces a distinct signal that is repeated at regular intervals during the course of
            the telephone conversation when the electronic recording is in use.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">Also, no electronic recording may be used unless it can be physically connected to
            and disconnected from the telephone line or switched on and off.</p>

        <p class="primary-content-p">The above FCC rule requirements apply to telephone common carriers. Similar
            requirements are imposed on consumers through the carriers' tariffs.</p>
